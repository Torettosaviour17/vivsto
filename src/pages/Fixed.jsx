          With Vivstock, you have the opportunity to invest your funds in a
          fixed deposit plan, offering a secure way to grow your investment. You
          can choose between two deposit terms: 6 months or 1 year, depending on
          your financial goals.
          <br />
          <br />
          6-Month Fixed Deposit: Opt for a 6-month term, and your funds will be
          locked in for the duration, earning you guaranteed interest. After 6
          months, you can withdraw your principal along with the accumulated
          interest.
          <br />
          <br />
          1-Year Fixed Deposit: For those looking for longer-term growth, the
          1-year fixed deposit option allows you to lock your funds for a full
          year. This term typically offers a higher return, rewarding your
          patience and commitment.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the end of your chosen term, you can easily withdraw both your
          initial deposit and the interest earned, or choose to reinvest your
          funds into another fixed deposit term. Vivstockâ€™s fixed deposit option
          ensures stability, predictable returns, and flexibility to match your
          investment preferences.
